# Python Input/Output Project

This project covers various aspects of Python input and output operations. It includes tasks related to reading and writing files, working with JSON data, and creating Python objects from JSON representations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.8.*
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or similar environment)

## Tasks

### Task 0: Read File

- Description: This task involves creating a function that reads a text file in UTF8 encoding and prints its content to stdout.
- File: `0-read_file.py`
- Usage: `./0-main.py` (Make sure to create a text file named `my_file_0.txt` with some content.)
- Example:

### Task 1: Write to a File

- Description: In this task, you'll implement a function that writes a string to a text file in UTF8 encoding and returns the number of characters written.
- File: `1-write_file.py`
- Usage: `./1-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 2: Append to a File

- Description: Create a function that appends a string to the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.
- File: `2-append_write.py`
- Usage: `./2-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 3: To JSON String

- Description: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object as a string.
- File: `3-to_json_string.py`
- Usage: `./3-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 4: From JSON String to Object

- Description: Implement a function that converts a JSON string into a Python object.
- File: `4-from_json_string.py`
- Usage: `./4-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 5: Save Object to a File

- Description: Create a function that writes a Python object to a text file using JSON representation.
- File: `5-save_to_json_file.py`
- Usage: `./5-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 6: Create Object from a JSON File

- Description: Implement a function that creates a Python object from a JSON file.
- File: `6-load_from_json_file.py`
- Usage: `./6-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 7: Load, Add, Save

- Description: Write a script that adds command-line arguments to a Python list and saves them to a JSON file.
- File: `7-add_item.py`
- Usage: `./7-add_item.py` (Use arguments like `"item1" "item2" ...`)
- Example:

### Task 8: Class to JSON

- Description: Implement a function that returns the JSON representation of a Python object (with simple data types).
- File: `8-class_to_json.py`
- Usage: `./8-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 9: Student to JSON

- Description: Create a class `Student` with attributes and methods to convert a student object to a JSON dictionary.
- File: `9-student.py`
- Usage: `./9-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 10: Student to JSON with Filter

- Description: Extend the `Student` class to allow filtering of attributes when converting to JSON.
- File: `10-student.py`
- Usage: `./10-main.py`
- Example:

### Task 11: Student to Disk and Reload

- Description: Modify the `Student` class to support saving to a JSON file and reloading from that file.
- File: `11-student.py`
- Usage: `./11-main.py student.json`
- Example:

### Task 12: Pascal's Triangle

- Description: Create a function to generate Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers.
- File: `12-pascal_triangle.py`
- Usage: `./12-main.py`
- Example:
