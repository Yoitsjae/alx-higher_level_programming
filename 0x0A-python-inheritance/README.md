# Python Inheritance Project

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you'll be able to:

- Explain the concept of inheritance in Python.
- Work with superclass (base class) and subclass.
- List attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- Inherit from another class.
- Override inherited methods or attributes.
- Use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
  - All your files must be executable
  - The length of your files will be tested using wc
- Python Test Cases
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - All your test files should be inside a folder tests
  - All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
  - All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
  - All your modules should have documentation
