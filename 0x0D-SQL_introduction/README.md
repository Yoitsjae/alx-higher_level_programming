###Project: SQL - Introduction

##Overview

This project provides an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language), its importance in coding, and its application in the context of a practical project. SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

##Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand what a database is.
Comprehend the concept of a relational database.
Define SQL and explain its significance in coding.
Familiarize yourself with MySQL.
Create a database in MySQL.
Understand the terms DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
Learn how to create or alter a table in SQL.
Grasp the basics of querying data from a table.
Perform operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on data.
Work with subqueries for advanced data retrieval.
Utilize MySQL functions for data analysis.
Usage in Coding
Database and Table Creation:
sql

-- Create a database
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
Data Manipulation:
sql
Copy code
-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email)
VALUES (1, 'john_doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;

-- Update data
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
Advanced Techniques:
sql
Copy code
-- Subqueries
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE total > (SELECT AVG(total) FROM orders);

-- Using Functions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

##Usage in the Project

In this project, SQL is employed to manage data effectively. The MySQL database is utilized, and various SQL operations are performed to interact with and manipulate the project's data. Understanding SQL concepts is essential for maintaining data integrity and optimizing data operations.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure you have MySQL installed on your system. You can refer to the installation guide for MySQL in Ubuntu 20.04.
